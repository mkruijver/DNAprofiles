\title{IBD probabilities}
\usage{
ibdprobs(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A pairwise relationship (e.g. "FS" for full siblings), or a 3-vector of IDB-probabilities.}
}
\value{
Numeric of length 3 with the probabilities that 0, 1 or 2 alleles are identical by descent
}
\description{
Returns the IBD probabilities for a pairwise relationship.
}
\details{
When a character vector is supplied, the function returns the IBD probabilities. The following pairwise relationships are supported:
\itemize{
\item "ID", identity/monozygotic twins
\item "FS", full siblings
\item "PO" alias "PC", parent/offspring
\item "HS", half siblings
\item "AV", uncle/nephew
\item "FC", first cousins
\item "SC", second cousins
\item "UN", unrelated
}

         When a numeric vector is supplied (e.g. c(0,1,0)), the function checks the input for validity and returns the input; throws an error otherwise.
}
\examples{
identical(ibdprobs("PO"),ibdprobs(c(0,1,0))) #TRUE
}
